#### An application requested by my friend

This application contains a collection of topics
In each topic, you can create multiple key-value pair  
In normal mode - only the key will be shown  
In eclipse mode - both key and value are shown  
You can toggle between modes by tapping in the sun icon at top-right corner
(Mode name, coloring and theme is inspired from shadow fight 2)

This is **NOT** meant to be a serious development project
